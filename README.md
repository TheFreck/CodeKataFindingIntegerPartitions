Notes:
Range : difference between the highest and lowest values.

Mean or Average : To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers in a set and then divide the sum by the total count of numbers.

Median : The median is the number separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)

Hints:
Try to optimize your program to avoid timing out.

Memoization can be helpful but it is not mandatory for being successful.
